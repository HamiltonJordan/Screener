Found following example of jQuery upload files on github.  I will play around with it and see if we can use it for large video files.

Also going to see if we can transform it to a drag and drop system.

** Github Repo for File Upload Demo **
https://github.com/arjunyonjan/jquery-multi-form-file-uploader-and-progress-bootstrap

** Update Note **
I have tried 3 times now with large (over 1gb) movies and they don't seem to upload.

Small (over 10mb less then 100mb) movies seem to work fine, large just doesn't want to go.
