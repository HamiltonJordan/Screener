		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<img id="logo" src="resources/s-logo.png">
		<p>Screener is an online application designed to allow Wheaton students to stream films and videos related to their coursework from anywhere on Wheaton’s campus. It is organized by an SQL database, managing discrete user accounts to connect students with only the films authorized by their own specific professors. Professors use Screener’s Instructor interface to add digital copies of films to the system. Screener is secured by a two-factor credential login system and Wheaton’s local Network firewall protections. As a compliment to e-services already made available by Wheaton College, this service provides students with access to otherwise unavailable educational content in a convenient and modern platform.</p>


		<h2>General Description</h2>
		<p>Screener provides Wheaton students an interface for viewing films their professor has assigned for class. Currently, a professor may assign a film and leave a copy outside his or her door for students to take turns viewing. However, this is a flawed system because only one student may watch the film at a time. Additionally, fewer and fewer Wheaton students have access to a DVD player, making viewing physical media additionally difficult. With Screener, students will be able to view the required course films without sharing a disc or illegally pirating content online. </p>
		<p>Any copyrighted content is illegal to host privately for public consumption according to copyright law in America. Even though our service hosts copyrighted content, it does not violate copyright law because it operates within the Classroom Use Exemption (17 U.S.C &amp;110(1)). This exemption allows for the viewing of any content within certain limitations: The viewer must be in a classroom or a place devoted to instruction (In this case, the entire Wheaton campus where Screener is available exclusively), and must be enrolled in a nonprofit educational institution. Screener satisfies these requirement by being only accessible on campus as well as being secured with a two factor authentication system (username and password) to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the content.</p>
		<p>Each teacher who registers with Screener will have an individual login for the site assigned by the system administrator. Ideally, their username and password would be the same as their Wheaton accounts. The students will only be able to select and to view the videos that have been shared with them, while the teacher can both select, upload, delete, and view the videos on the site.</p>
